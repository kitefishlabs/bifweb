      [:p "The buffalo “infringement” festival is a non-profit-driven, non-hierarchical grassroots endeavor bringing
         together a broad range of eclectic, independent, experimental, and controversial art of all forms. Visual,
         performing, musical, and media arts are all welcome here. Taking place in multiple venues in and around Buffalo’s
         Allentown District, the festival is an annual eleven-day event running from the last weekend of July through the
         first weekend of August. See the Infringement Festival International's " [:a {:href "#mandate"} "mandate"] " and our 2006 Mission Statement to
         learn more."]

      [:p "The infringement Festival is an interdisciplinary festival open to all critical artists. Celebrating freedom of
        expression and designed as a real arts democracy, this festival is a critical response to the oppressive neoliberal
        worldview and all its billboard trucks, televisions, flyers, advertisements, jingles, made-for-TV Wars; and the
        depoliticisation of people through this diversionary Spectacle."]

      [:p "The infringement welcomes a variety of performances
        and cultural resistance: theatre groups, performers, street activism, political theatre, musicians, radical performance,
        visual artists, films, marginalized arts, spoken-word, puppet shows, disadvantaged groups, and anyone wishing to
        artistically infringe on the monoculture that creeps into every corner of our lives."]

      [:p "The festival aims to emphasize both critical practice in the arts, and artistic practice in activism. It also
        aims to provide a positive environment that encourages and nurtures critical art."]

      [:p "To avoid being co-opted, the infringement festival follows a mandate that looks like this:"

        [:ol
          [:li "The infringement festival is free for all artists and activists to participate in. The festival will never
            charge a registration fee and participants will keep 100% of their box office."]
          [:li "The festival is open to all critical artists and will never discriminate, set entry criteria or censor."]
          [:li "The festival is run as a non-hierarchical arts democracy."]
          [:li "The festival will only accept ethical companies that pose no conflict of interest as sponsors, as the
            interests of the festival’s participants come before those of the sponsors. (Our criteria for ethical sponsorship
            is available here[TBA].)"]

         [:li "The festival will encourage, although not be limited to, progressive acts that encourage discussion and
          oppose oppressive structures."]]]]
