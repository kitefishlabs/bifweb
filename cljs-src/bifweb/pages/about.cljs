          expression and designed as a real arts democracy, this festival is a critical response to the oppressive neoliberal
          worldview and all its billboard trucks, televisions, flyers, advertisements, jingles, made-for-TV Wars; and the
          depoliticisation of people through this diversionary Spectacle."]

          and cultural resistance: theatre groups, performers, street activism, political theatre, musicians, radical performance,
          visual artists, films, marginalized arts, spoken-word, puppet shows, disadvantaged groups, and anyone wishing to
          artistically infringe on the monoculture that creeps into every corner of our lives."]

          aims to provide a positive environment that encourages and nurtures critical art."]

              charge a registration fee and participants will keep 100% of their box office."]

            [:li "The festival is run as a non-hierarchical arts democracy."]
            [:li "The festival will only accept ethical companies that pose no conflict of interest as sponsors, as the
              interests of the festival’s participants come before those of the sponsors. (Our criteria for ethical sponsorship
              is available here[TBA].)"]
